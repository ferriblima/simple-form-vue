# Simple Form Vue Project

## About The Project

**Simple Form Vue Project** is a web application built with Vue.js that demonstrates a modern, modular form interface. The application collects various user inputs—including text, numbers, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a custom star-based rating component—and is prepared to integrate with API endpoints for further processing.
